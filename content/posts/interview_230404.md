## 关于面试问题的一篇英文推

最近在推上看到了一名CEO写的关于面试会问的几个问题，觉得有参考意义，所以写下来.  文末附中文。

> I’ve interviewed 1000s of people over my career. Most leaders ask the same terrible questions every time. Ask these 13 questions and I guarantee you'll make better hiring decisions:
>
> 
>
> \#1: If you were to tell a friend about our company, how would you describe what we do? Preparedness. How much do they know about your business? Mission. Vision. Values. If they are marketing/sales hires and can’t answer this, the interview is over.
>
> \#2: What’s the most influential book you’ve ever read? I bias toward perpetual learners. Showing that they are always wanting to improve themselves is an indicator of humility.
>
> \#3: Do you have written goals? How often do you revisit these? Driven people tend to have goals. No written goals? Dig deeper into what motivates them.
>
> \#4: What is a moment you are not proud of in your career? Humility. You want people who aren’t afraid of their past, especially the things you aren’t proudest of.
>
> \#5: How do you handle an apology? As a leader, I want to encourage constructive conflict. But sometimes things get out of hand at work. How people show up in these moments matters.
>
> \#7: How did the culture of your last company empower or disempower you? Everyone talks about wanting a great culture. This is a test to see how much they actually think about it.
>
> \#8: What was your greatest contribution to your last company? Giving them a chance to show off their work. We want to see if they mention their team. Or is it just a “me” show?
>
> \#9: What are the characteristics of the best boss you’ve ever had? This is a nice way to see what kind of leader they respond well to. You should be looking for a fit with whomever they would report to in the organization.
>
> \#10: Tell me something you’re proud of that will never make it onto a resume. Resumes are boring, polished turds. They tell us little about the actual person we're talking to. Use this to learn a little about what lights them up beyond pure work.
>
> \#11: Tell me something that’s true that almost nobody agrees with you on. Most people stumble on this question. We're looking for those that have really creative answers. Skip the obvious (politics).
>
> \#12: If we're sitting here a year from now celebrating the last 12 months, what did we achieve together? 
>
> The job description has clear goals in it. 
>
> They should respond by having accomplished those.
>
> \#13: How much money do you expect to be earning when you start? What about in 3 years? This shows how hungry they really are. We hire for humble, hungry, and smart. This is a strong test of their ambition.
>
> These aren’t conventional interview questions, and that's the point. Everyone is ready to be asked the same questions in every interview, and most of the time, you don't even get what you need to make a good hiring decision. Use these questions instead.
