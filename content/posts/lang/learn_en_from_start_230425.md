来自视频 [跟着女星练听力](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUFbCWRUbEg&t=20s)

> Q: How much time do I wait to call her ?



根据听力，自己逐字写下来：

No time! I say text to immeditally . The whole waiting thing is missing is over is dead.  going to call her immediallty is instead. 

I mean don't call her right away actually xxx, but text her, text her right after a day . text her right after you text her. it's cute. 

实际的是:

> A: No time. I say text immediately. The whole waiting thing is a myth. It's over. It's dead. Girls like to hear from you immediately, they know that you are interested. I mean, don't call her right away actually, literally, because that's totally creepy. But text her. Text her right after the date. Text her right after you texted her. It's cute.



评估一下结果， 根据自己写的，大意是能听出来的，但是语法、词汇错误很多。

* immediately 迅速地，突然地
* myth n. 传说，神话
* literally 字面上地
* creepy   爬行， causing an unpleasant feeling of fear or unease.



I don't believe the myths and legends about this forest.



hear from someone 得到某人的消息

I haven't heard anything from her lately.



cute 可爱的；聪明的；狡猾的；

Don't get cute from me.
